## WNCC SOC 2021 - Assignment
### Checkpoint 3 
All the (2/4) Model Implementation along with their training are present in Part 3

> Due to resource constrains models have been only partially trained 2-5 epochs.

Yet following points can be mentioned:
1. VGGNet trained very fast compared to AlexNet.
2. Performance of AlexNet however was better on training set , VGG being simple probably overfitted.

This repo is for the assignment done during course 1 and course 2 (some are left) for deep learning specialization on coursera.
